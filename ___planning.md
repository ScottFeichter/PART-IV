WIREFRAME

I used Figma to create the wireframe. This had a little bit of a learning curve and took longer than what I felt was worth the effort versus how useful it is.

However I wanted to follow the process so I can do more in the future. I did not understand how to get the wireframe out of Figma so here is a link to it:
